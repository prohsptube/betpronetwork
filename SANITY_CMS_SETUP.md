## 🎯 What Happens Next?

### Current Blog System:
Your current blogs are still files in `src/app/blog/`. They'll continue to work.

### CMS Blogs (Future):
Once you add your Project ID and create posts in CMS, you can:
- **Option 1:** Update blog page to fetch from CMS
- **Option 2:** Keep both (file-based + CMS)
- **Option 3:** Migrate old posts to CMS manually

**For now:** Your site works as-is. The CMS is ready when you are!
